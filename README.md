Engineer with over 12 years of experience in structural analysis and modeling seeking an opportunity to expand my technical expertise into software development. Scripting and data management have been a significant and very enjoyable part of my career. Over the past year, I expanded on this ability by formally studying Python programming and completed the Certificate in Python Programming series from the University of Washington. I look forward to combining this new skill set with my extensive engineering background to explore and solve new and challenging problems.
