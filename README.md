Mechanical engineer with 15 years of experience in computational analysis and modeling supporting the design of new aircraft structure. Seeking a professional opportunity to solve technical/scientific/data-oriented problems through Python software development. Over the past year, I have been studying Python programming in a UNIX environment and will complete my certification in Python Programming from the University of Washington in December 2021. I look forward to combining my strong analytical background with this new skill and discovering new and complex problems and their solutions.
