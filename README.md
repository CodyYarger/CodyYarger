Engineer experienced in computational analysis and modeling. Seeking a professional opportunity to solve technical/scientific/data-oriented problems through Python software development. Over the past year, I have been studying Python programming in a UNIX/Linux environment and recently received the Certificate in Python Programming from the University of Washington. I look forward to combining these tools and my strong analytical background to explore and solve new and challenging problems.
